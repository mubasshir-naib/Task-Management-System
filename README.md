# Task-Management-System
BootCamp
Overview: A web application where users can manage tasks. Each user has an account, and tasks are assigned to them. The application will allow CRUD operations on tasks and provide the ability to set deadlines, change task status, and receive notifications.	 	 	 
Features to Implement:	 

1	User Authentication:	 	 
Sign up, login, and logout functionality using ASP.NET Core Identity.	 
Password reset and profile management.	 

2	Task Management:	 	 
CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).	 
 	Ability to set a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed).	 
  
3	Authorization:	 	 
Restrict certain operations to logged-in users only.	 
Each user can only view and modify their own tasks.	 

4	AJAX for Dynamic Task Updates:	 	 
Use AJAX to update the task list in real-time without refreshing the page.	 
Dynamically change the status of tasks using AJAX.	 

5	Email Notifications:	Set up email notifications to alert users of upcoming deadlines or when a taskâ€™s status changes.	 
 	 
6	Deployment:	Deploy the application to Azure or IIS and ensure the project is accessible over the web.
